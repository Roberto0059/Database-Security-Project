<h2> Database-Security-Project </h2>

- In this milestone, I have integrated all the components from the previous milestones. The first portion of this
milestone presents a demonstration of SQL Map. I used a set of tools to access the databases of a vulnerable web
application. By the end of this demonstration, the contents of the databases that display confidential information could
be displayed. Next, I incorporated a literature review on projects employing SQL Map, evaluating their strategies
for exploiting vulnerabilities. Sourcing from Google Scholar, the review details include recent studies, analyses, and
comparative studies. Lastly, the benchmark study assesses SQL Mapâ€™s effectiveness in detecting and exploiting SQL
injection vulnerabilities across diverse websites, aiming to provide insights into its capabilities and limitations.

<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b> Burp Suite: Burp Suite is preinstalled within Kali Linux and has the essential features needed to learn the fundamentals of web application security </b>
- <b> OWASP Juice Shop: OWASP Juice Shop is a vulnerable web application that contains a lot of fun challenges and exercises to help people develop their skills in web application security.</b>
- <b> Kali Linux : Kali Linux is a Debian-based Linux distribution specifically designed for digital forensics and
penetration testing.
- <b> SQL Map : SQL map is an open-source tool that automates detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and
gaining control of database servers.


<h2>Environments Used </h2>
- <b>Kali Linux</b>
